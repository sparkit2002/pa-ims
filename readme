In designing my code I broke the duties of my program into different objects, found in artist.rb, app.rb, and controller.rb.  All the ims.rb
file is responsible for is obtaining user input, and sending it to the controller.  The controller then parses the string, checking to see if
the command is valid.  If it is, the command is then sent to the app, which then executes it.
